    "| education | ordinal encoding | A categorical feature with no missing values, so no imputation required. Additionally, we can put the different education levels in order (e.g. : Preschool < 1st-4th < ... < Doctorate). Therefore, we can apply ordinal encoding here. |\n",

Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.)
